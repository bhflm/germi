# About me

my own tale-written timeline (long for resume): 

I'm a software developer with experience across many industries, always pivoting across the startup ecosystem. 

I do find myself the most productive whenever I can see tangible changes in short periods of time, usually, this happens whenever eng teams are somewhat small sized (5-8ppl).

From latest to the very beggining, following is my career path: 


### SuperRare Labs (Aug - Sept 2023)

Joined the team as Senior Software Engineer for the backend services. Challenge was super interesting, they had to revamp their current architecture, because,
as in software usually happens, they were dealing with some complex legacy codebase which needed to be revamped gradually. 

Challenge itself did look amazing, an important NFT marketplace looking to rebuild their own services over their existing current codebase! (they have some
interest things built with Haskell that, its kinda frightening at the very beggining but you get used to it). The whole idea was to build up an event-driven architecture 
which involved many transactions being indexed from the blockchain, + lots of user interactions (surprisingly, marketplaces do 
have many complex business interactions, did you imagine ?), like bidding, buying, selling, following another user, etc. 

Sadly, 4 weeks in, they did layoff half of their entire staff :'), me included. So I did not had the chance to make a full meaningful impact over the product. 


### Fleek (2020-2023)

Fleek was a blast. Had you ever considered mixing what vercel is + somewhat degree of decentralization ?. 
Its a really great no-code platform which lets you deploy your site over IPFS for free. 
Literally, free. You get a fleek subdomain (similar to what vercel domains are), which is already distributed by under-the-hood magic over
the IPFS network. 

Started as a software developer and gained lots of knowledge, it was a based hybrid event-driven system (due to the nature of the sites deploy pipeline), built 
over a serverless architecture, so we relied a lot on Lambdas, SQS, Fargate, and SNS. The team I've worked with is among the very best I had the pleasure to share!. 

Fun things are, that whenever you're offering a free product over the internet, -even more when you add the web3 factor-, probably your userbase isn't going to be 
as expected, meaning, lots of deploys of scammy "get your 10ETH for free please put your private key here" type of sites. 
Which did result in lots of customer support tickets for phishing flagged sites and reports from cloudflare (what we used by that time). 

Over the time we had to switch back and forth to Bunny CDN, because of the amount of reports and phishing flags we had over our sites (which provided the static assets), 
so as you might guess, whenever you visited a fleek site, sometimes, if we were under phishing reports, you might expect some red giant screen warning saying that 
we were probably going to scam you as well. 

This was progressively diminished by the elaboration of a robust phishing module which took some factors from a user profile and the sites they've deployed, to assess if it 
was a possible scam site or not. Reducing the customer support overhead to deal with this. 

Also, elaborated somewhat an internal monitoring module which did let us see if the internal pipeline deploy platform was working ok.

Got to contribute from many perspectives, backend, frontend, product, QA, hell, even customer support. Even gave a workshop at ETHDenver @ Encode Club's hacker house (The PIT).

Such a great experience!. 

##  Properati - OLX Group (Nov 2019 - Jul 2020)

Properati is a real state LATAM site, for finding a new place to live!. 

Formed part as a fullstack engineer, for the product team, and partly for the core. It was a really interesting experience because I've got to get my feet wet 
with Golang and some interesting stuff within GCP. 

My tasks were really related to the product marketing team scope, so I was mostly doing features related to SEO and UI. 

Also got to get my hands on a giant codebase made with Jquery and RoR, which was quite amazing to see it in the flesh. It did manage a heavy throughput !.

## Wolox (nowadays Accenture) - (2018-2019)

Started my career as a jr Software developer, with Node.js. 

Got to experiment a lot with Node.js and React, I wanted to dive deep onto these technologies and they did let me. It was an amazing first experience.

Got the chance to work within several projects, from where I did get used to set myself up really quickly on new codebases. 

Learned most of the guidelines I carry myself with today! and got to meet many great developers I consider them really important.

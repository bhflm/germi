Hey there ðŸ‘‹!, I'm German (not the country, neither the noun), a software developer passionate about complex systems and how computers break. 

Lastly I've been working at the web3 ecosystem, finding joy pushing the boundaries of novel technologies. I believe they're many cases where blockchains could solve many of our daily issues (I'm looking at you, traditional banks).

Among my previous work, I've helped building https://fleek.co, -which is quite similar to Vercel, but with a web3ish aggregator, it runs with IPFS under the hood (remember bit torrent?)-

I find joy doing backend stuff, but I really thrive crafting hacky things and finding my way around problems. Building meaningful stuff for people to use is among the best feelings I've had!.

tldr; I like computers, and sharing knowledge and stories about them.

got a good story ? or just want to get in touch ? feel free to email me at germanbonin@gmail.com
